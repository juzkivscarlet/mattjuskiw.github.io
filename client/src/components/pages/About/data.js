			`I had what I deem to be a rather introverted childhood. While most other kids my age were playing video games, watching tv, 
			or any other typical childhood hobbies, I preferred to explore and learn about various interests, such as foreign languages, 
			musicianship, and, of course, <span class="font-italic">coding</span>. Although coding stopped being a hobby of mine by high school, 
			and despite making only basic programs, the conceptual, literal thinking behind the logic of coding had already been well 
			developed. `,
			`After turning 19 years old, I rediscovered my passion for coding, and enrolled myself in the Case Western Reserve University 
			Full-stack Web Development bootcamp, which is taking place from July 2019 until February 2020. `

			solace in strumming the strings of my various guitars after long, exhausting school days.`,
			`I love several different styles of music, but mainly pop-punk, post-hardcore, metalcore, and math rock.`

			`I graduated from Nordonia High School in Macedonia, OH, as a member of the Class of 2018.`,
			`While at Nordonia HS, I took three years of German language classes, and I consider myself to be conversationally fluent in German.`,
			`I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome (now a part of the Autism Spectrum Disorders) around age 10. 
			When working with me, make sure to be direct, honest, and literal in your communication, as these easy things will go a long way.
			I am quite comfortable with my diagnosis, and I'm very willing to discuss anything about it. `
